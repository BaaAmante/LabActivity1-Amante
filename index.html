    </header>
    <div>"You got to let go" (yeah, yeah)</div>
    <div>Maybe it's a little too late</div>
    <div>'Cause I already put my all to the table</div>
    <div>Everything about me from the get go (I wanted that)</div>
    <div>There goes another love song (la-la-la)</div>
    <div>Hate that it's becoming my usual (usual)</div>
    <div>Taking things slow, I just can't control</div>
    <div>Baby, I'm incapable of it</div>
    <br>
    <div>Then one day (you show up)</div>
    <div>You show up like heaven sent you here</div>
    <div>So I say (hello), how you doin' nice to meet you</div>
    <div>All my friends (no, no) are telling me, she might be bad news</div>
    <div>Now I can't go back</div>
    <div>Yeah, you know I'm caught up in you</div>
    <br>
    <div>I get obsessed so easily</div>
    <div>Like honestly what the fuck is wrong with me</div>
    <div>I go two nights out with a girl and I think I'm in love (in love, in love)</div>
    <div>Why do I fall so easily</div>
    <div>Or is it that she's so perfect for me</div>
    <div>I can't keep on meeting the love of my life like this</div>
    <div>But I guess I'm obsessed with you (yeah, yeah)</div>
    <div>You, you</div>
    <br>
    <div>Think I'm doing better (yeah, yeah)</div>
    <div>Took a little but I got my head on (straight)</div>
    <div>Finally, takin a good care of me myself and</div>
    <div>I don't wanna wait no more (uh huh)</div>
    <br>
    <div>Trying everything I can like meditating</div>
    <div>Keeping myself busy down to every second</div>
    <div>So I don't have time to fantasize</div>
    <div>What could've been like you and I</div>
    <br>
    <div>But then again (you show up)</div>
    <div>You show up like heaven sent you here</div>
    <div>So I say (hello), how you doin' nice to meet you</div>
    <div>Is all the blame on me 'cause you can't deny your natural beauty</div>
    <div>Now I can't go back</div>
    <div>Yeah, you know I'm caught up in you</div>
    <br>
    <div>I get obsessed so easily</div>
    <div>Like honestly what the fuck is wrong with me</div>
    <div>I go two nights out with a girl and I think I'm in love (in love, in love)</div>
    <div>Why do I fall so easily</div>
    <div>Or is it that she's so perfect for me</div>
    <div>I can't keep on meeting the love of my life like this</div>
    <div>But I guess I'm obsessed with you (yeah, yeah)</div>
    <div>You, you</div>
    <div>I get obsessed so easily</div>
    <div>Like honestly what the fuck is wrong with me</div>
    <div>I go two nights out with a girl and I think I'm in love</div>
    <div>And why do I fall so easily</div>
    <div>Or is it that she's so perfect for me</div>
    <div>I can't keep on meeting the love of my life like this</div>
    <div>But I guess I'm obsessed with you (yeah, yeah)</div>
    <div>You, you (la-da-di-la-la, du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-ru)</div>
    <div>You, you</div>
